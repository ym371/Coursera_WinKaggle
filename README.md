## Course information
* **Course title:** How to Win a Data Science Competition: Learn from Top Kagglers
* I attended this course on Coursera from August to September 2020. Before taking this course, I have had some basic knowledge about common Machine Learning models and relevant Python packages (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, scikit-learn etc). I found this course extremely informative (and hence may take up longer time than it suggests). It is also highly practical, focusing on the practical realisation rather than the theoretical knowledge of Machine Learning. So it is very suitable for people who have learned some theoretical knowledge, but do not know where to start to appy them. Many tricks that could only be learned by experience is taught in the course. Generally, a great course that I must recommend.
